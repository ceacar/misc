‘Insertion Sort Advanced Analysis’ Solution
Posted on July 19, 2015 by Martin
Short Problem Definition:
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting technique which was covered in previous challenges. Sometimes, arrays may be too large for us to wait around for insertion sort to finish. Is there some other way we can calculate the number of times Insertion Sort shifts each elements when sorting an array?

If ki is the number of elements over which the ith element of the array has to shift, then the total number of shifts will be k1 +k2 +…+kN.

Insertion Sort Advanced Analysis

Complexity:
time complexity is O(N*log(N))

space complexity is O(1)


Array	Shifts
[4,3,2,1] 
[3,4,2,1] 1
[2,3,4,1] 2
[1,2,3,4] 3

Total shifts = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
