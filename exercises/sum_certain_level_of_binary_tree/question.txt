sum up certain level of binary tree



lets say we have a tree

5------
|      |
3-     8--
| |    |  |
2 4    7  9--
|            |
1            10


sum up the thrid level so it returns 2+4+7+9 = 22


lets traverse the entire tree in bfs way

[5]

[8,3]

[9,7,4,2]

[10 1]

so the final output is  
5,3,8,2,4,7,9,10,1

solutions:
1. just keep track of level of recursion, the level is indicated when the array is poped empty


2. if we padding the nodes with 0

first level size is 1
second level size is 2
thrid level size is 4
so we can calcualte where to sum up
